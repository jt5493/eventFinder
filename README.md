# EventFinder

Welcome to EventFinder. This interactive application will allow the user to find upcoming events in their zipcode. After finding those events, the user can then see all the event details including: which venue it is located at, the date the event will take place, whether the event is sold out or not, the genre of the event, and even information on how to purchase tickets.

## Install

To run the program just clone the repository from Github. Then in the terminal type `bundle install`. 


## Usage
