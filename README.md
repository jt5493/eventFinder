# EventFinder

Welcome to EventFinder. This interactive application will allow the user to find upcoming events in their zipcode. After finding those events, the user can then see all the event details including: which venue it is located at, the date the event will take place, whether the event is sold out or not, the genre of the event, and even information on how to purchase tickets.


## Usage

To get started just type bin/eventFinder in your terminal and follow along with the prompts. You can type exit at any time to stop the application.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
